        "1.  **wiki_search**: This worker is a specialist that queries Wikipedia. Use it for "
        "well-defined, encyclopedic topics such as historical events, scientific concepts, "
        "biographies of famous people, or specific places. It is highly effective for "

        "Use it for timely or recent events, current affairs, opinions, product reviews, or "
        "any open-ended question where the best source is not a single encyclopedia page. "
        "It is also the correct choice if the user's query is ambiguous.\n\n"

        "- **Step 1: Analyze the user's request.** Is it a request for a well-known, factual topic, or is it a broader, more current query?\n"
        "- **Step 2: Choose the best worker.** If the request is a clear fit for an encyclopedia article, choose `wiki_search`. For all other research tasks, or if you are unsure, choose `web_search` as the default.\n"
        "- **Step 3: Respond with only the worker's name.** For example, if you decide on the web searcher, your output must be `web_search`.\n"
        "- **Step 4: Conclude the task.** Once a worker has provided a satisfactory result, you must respond with `FINISH` to end the process."
